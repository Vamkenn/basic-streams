This is a take on [async-problem](https://github.com/plaid/async-problem) with basic-strems.
We'll also use [data.validation](https://github.com/folktale/data.validation)
to represent failures since basic-strems don't have built-in support of failures.

You need `node@>=5.0` to run the code.

```
npm install
node index.js
```
