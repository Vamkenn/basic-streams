This a take on [async-problem](https://github.com/plaid/async-problem) with basic-strems.
We'll also use [data.validation](https://github.com/folktale/data.validation)
to represent failures since basic-strems don't have built-in support of failures.

We use ES6 so `node@>=5` is required.

```
npm install
npm start
```
